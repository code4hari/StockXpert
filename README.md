# StockXpert

StockXpert revolutionizes stock market prediction by implementing a dual-validation pipeline: first, my trained ML models analyze historical market data to generate price forecasts, then these predictions are validated through Claude AI's real-time analysis of company fundamentals and market conditions. This unique ML-GenAI hybrid approach delivers more reliable investment insights through an intuitive chat interface, effectively combining quantitative predictions with qualitative market intelligence

To run the ML -> AI pipeline simply clone the repository and run the dashboard.py file using"Streamlit run dashboard.py" This should start the server on local host and you should be able to try the pipeline.
